plog
----

plog is a logging module for psotnic.

Requirements
------------

psotnic 0.2.14 or newer.


Installation
------------

1) extract the tarball

extract the tarball in psotnic*/modules/, so that so that you have psotnic*/modules/plog/

2) compile the module

go to plog/ directory and compile it with:
 g++ main.cpp plog.cpp misc.cpp -o ../plog.so -shared

If it does not work, try again with -fPIC

This should have created a file named "plog.so" in modules/

3) load the module

Append a line similar to this to the config file of your bot:

 load /path/to/psotnic/modules/plog.so

or load the module while the bot is running with this partyline command:

 .bc <bot> cfg +load /path/to/psotnic/modules/plog.so

To verify that the module is loaded, type:

 .bc <bot> modules


Configuration
-------------

Logging is disabled by default, so that you can choose a path first where you want to store the logs
and to choose what should be logged.

1) choose a path

Default is "logs/$0.log" while $0 is a variable for the target (e.g. "#psotnic").
It supports also strftime format.

Set the path:

 .bc <bot> plog set path /path/to/logs/$0.log

strftime example:

 .bc <bot> plog set path /path/to/logs/%Y/%M/%d/$0.log

 will create logs like: /path/to/logs/2008/07/27/#psotnic.log

It is recommended to set an absoulte path, otherwise the location depends on how you start psotnic.


2) adjust other global settings (not necessary)

To see all global settings: .bc <bot> plog set

This step can be skipped.


3) specify what you want to log

For client logging (connected, disconnected, got msg, kline etc):

 .bc <bot> plog clientset

If you want to log channels, add them first:

 .bc <bot> plog addchan <channel>

and then choose what you want to log there:

 .bc <bot> plog chanset <channel>


4) enable logging

 .bc <bot> plog clientset log ON
 .bc <bot> plog chanset <channel> log ON

Send a message (or anything else that should be logged) to your bot and to a logged channel to test it.

That's all!


5) overview of commands

 .bc <bot> plog set [<key> [<value>]]
 .bc <bot> plog clientset [<key> [<value>]]
 .bc <bot> plog addchan <channel>
 .bc <bot> plog chans
 .bc <bot> plog delchan <channel>
 .bc <bot> plog chanset <channel> [<key> [<value>]]

for all channels, use "chanset * .."

Sorry but the commands are not very handy :)


Further hints
-------------

Safe channels must be added with id, e.g. !EX2TMpsotnic

If you need logs only as evidence for takeovers:

 .bc <bot> plog chanset <channel> log-msg OFF
 .bc <bot> plog chanset <channel> log-notice OFF
 .bc <bot> plog chanset <channel> log-topic OFF
