In this directory you can find easy-rsa scripts. I borrowed them from openvpn
package (http://openvpn.net), so credit goes to them :>

Here is the list of instructions needed for generating necessary files:

	. ./vars
	./clean-all
	./build-ca
	./build-key-server server

When asked for challenge password hit enter - empty pass.
When asked whether to sign the certificate answer yes.
When asked whether to commit certificate answer yes.

If you dont get those questions it means that you made an error.

After you finish generating files, copy server.key and server.crt
to the directory where you have main's dir.

That's all.
