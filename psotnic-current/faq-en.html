<b>Q</b>: When will you release binary version of the newest bot?<br>
<b>A</b>: Never.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Why?<br>
<b>A</b>: Because you can compile it yourself.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: What's new in x.y.z version?<br>
<b>A</b>: See changelog.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Psotnic works correctly on linux, but have &lt;x y z&gt; problem on cygwin, what's wrong?<br>
<b>A</b>: I dont know, ask the cygwin devel team, not me.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: "[-] Screw you guys, this file is hacked", wtf?<br>
<b>A</b>: That error means that psotnic didnt pass self consistency
check so that it wont start, that usualy happens when binary file gets
moddifed in any way or when box your system is running on is somehow
damaged (it might be caused by overheated cpu, bad memory module,
etc.), there is also another possibility that system has unstable
kernel installed or one of main system libraries is broken.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Is there any way to run non static version of psotnic on a shell that does not have proper version of libstdc++.so? <br>
<b>A</b>: Yes, all you have to do is to download correct libstdc++.so.5
lib (it can be found in doom3 linux patch package) and then copy it to
some directory at your home, then do export
LD_PRELOAD='/path/to/that/dir/libstdc++.so.5', and start the bot.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Do i have to put slaves and/or main on irc?<br>
<b>A</b>: No.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: My bots do not want to connect to irc server, but i can connect to irc via other irc clients, what did i do wrong?<br>
<b>A</b>: First of all double check corectness of the vhost you have
typed in, second make sure that ip is present in the system (you could
be nated), if ip is not present put 0.0.0.0 as your ip :).<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Why main does not join channels?<br>
<b>A</b>: Try adding host to main's handle (psotnic bots do not join channels if their host is not added into their handle).<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Why do bots place ban on *!*@*.siol.net(or simillar) ?<br>
<b>A</b>: This ban results from proxy clone protection, bots ban given
isp when they detect that number of ppl having identless connection
exceeds value of .set proxy-clones, if you do not want to ban given
isp, simply add a new user, give him +c channel flags and add hosts
witch you would like to exclude from clone protection, if you want to
completely turn off that kind of protection simply set proxy-clones to
0.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Whats the difference between static and non staic version?<br>
<b>A</b>: Static version includes all system libraries needed to start
the bot in itself, contrary to non static version witch is has library
dependensies. Furthermore non static (=dynamic) binary provides dynamic
module loading interface witch allows you to load custom pieces of code.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: I get following error: `[!] Invalid packet: 62 Barklays BanjaLuka 27 #celjani', what should i do?<br>
<b>A</b>: Unlink slave to which `Barklays' is connected to.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: How to add psotnic to cron?<br>
<b>A</b>: Just run `./psotnic -a conf1 conf2 conf3' and so on.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Why do i get `Lost 123.123.123.123 / 12345 (Leaf123: not a slave)' error on the partyline?<br>
<b>A</b>: Because you have told your leaf to connect to main bot instead of the slave bot.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Main's userlist is broken, can i do about it?<br>
<b>A</b>: Login into any slave's account, change your slave's config in
such a way to make it main bot (simple removal of hub line should do
the trick), then start the slave. You should notice that your slave has
just become main bot :). Log into new main and .export userlist, then
send exported file to your real main's account and setup new main from
the scrach, then login into it and .import userfile witch you have just
uploaded. Please note that all .info and .shit expiration information
will be lost !!!<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: How to part a bots from a channel containing `strange' caracters in its name?<br>
<b>A</b>: Type .channels, get the number of channel that interests you
(start counting from 1 :P), type .mpart &lt;number of channel&gt;.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: How to add bot with dynamic ip?<br>
<b>A</b>: Simply set myipv4, vhost and bot's address to 0.0.0.0,
additionaly you can give your bot `p' flag which will allow bot to
update its temporary host everytime it gets connected to irc.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: Will there ever be a version for windows?<br>
<b>A</b>: You have the source, get cygwin and compile it for yourself.<br>
<br>
<b>Q</b>: How to remove 'x' user?<br>
<b>A</b>: .export userfile, edit it (remove 'x' flag), .import edited userlist and remove the user :)<br>
