There are <strong>3 ways</strong> to login into the botnet:<br />

<ol><ol>
        <li>Telnet</li>
        <li>DCC</li>
        <li>SSL</li>
    </ol></li>
</ol>

<br />
<h3 id="toc0">Telnet</h3>
Telnet mode consists to connect to the hub through a client that supports telnet protocol like<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/" rel="nofollow"> Putty</a>, Penguinet, SecureCRT, and obviously Telnet (free and available in any platform).<br />
For example:<br />

<style type="text/css"><!--
/* GeSHi (c) Nigel McNie 2004 (http://qbnz.com/highlighter) */
.text .imp {font-weight: bold; color: red;}

-->
</style><pre class="text">telnet box1.shellprovider.com 31337</pre>

Oh Oh! Got an empty screen? Don't care, it is normal!<br />
Before to see any signs of life by the hub <u>you have to type the <em>ownerpassword</em></u> then, if correct, you will see the login request.<br />
Too hard for you? Then you might consider to use a dedicated client like Psotnic Client and EaZy Psotnic.<br />
<br />
<strong>DCC</strong><br />
DCC (Direct Client Connection) mode consists to connect to the hub through a DCC Chat using your preferred IRC Client (Kvirc, Xchat, mIRC, etc).<br />
For example:<br />

<style type="text/css"><!--
/* GeSHi (c) Nigel McNie 2004 (http://qbnz.com/highlighter) */
.text .imp {font-weight: bold; color: red;}

-->
</style><pre class="text">/DCC chat hubnickname</pre>

If you can't host a DCC session because you are firewalled or behind a NAT (eg: router) you can start a passive DCC<br />
by asking the hub to host a session for you using the <strong>chat</strong> command.<br />
For example:<br />

<style type="text/css"><!--
/* GeSHi (c) Nigel McNie 2004 (http://qbnz.com/highlighter) */
.text .imp {font-weight: bold; color: red;}

-->
</style><pre class="text">/msg hubnickname chat</pre>

You will see a DCC chat request from the hub bot.<br />
Doesn't it work? Make sure you have inserted a correct IP in the <em>myipv4</em> directive in the config file.<br />
<br />
<strong>SSL</strong><br />
SSL connection works in a similar way as telnet connection, with the exception that all transfered data is being encrypted.<br />
<br />
In order to connect to hub you have to use some kind of SSL-enabled client. In the example bellow I present use ssl client from <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://openssl.org" rel="nofollow">openssl</a> ulity:<br />

<style type="text/css"><!--
/* GeSHi (c) Nigel McNie 2004 (http://qbnz.com/highlighter) */
.text .imp {font-weight: bold; color: red;}

-->
</style><pre class="text">openssl s_client -connect box1.shellprovider.com:12345</pre>

<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You can only connect to hub which has <em>ssl_listen</em> port open. Any SSL connections directed to ordinary <em>listen</em> port (the one used for telnet) will FAIL.<br />
<br />
After connection has been established, you have to supply ownerpassword (as with telnet connection bot won't ask you for it, you just have to type it in), username and password.
