(sorry for the crappy README file, but I can't be arsed to write a proper one :P)
You need to create a mysql db for this to work, and then create a user with access to the db.  Seeing as how you are at worst storing the uid/upw in a text file and at best in an exe file (strings can be retrieved with ease still), its best to create a new user for this that has select,insert,update and delete privs just on this db.  Then, use this user for the any of the attached modules you use.

Once you have the db created, run the script to create the table(s) format like:
  mysql -u <user> -p <db> < <module>.sql

If that goes well then you are done with the mysql side.  You need to then setup the module before compiling it by changing the DB_USER, DB_PASS and DB_NAME values and possibly DB_HOST, DB_PORT and DB_TABLE values too (depending on your setup).

If you use the seen module, you should also setup a cronjob to run daily that will execute the seen-tidy.sql script against the db to tidy it up.  If you want to keep records for longer than 30 days then edit the script and change the 30 to whatever you want.  The cron command you will need (remembering to use full paths) is:
  <path-to-mysql-client>mysql -u <user> --password=<pass> <db> < <path-to-script>seen-tidy.sql >/dev/null 2>&1

And thats about it.. any questions, complaints or comments should be sent to Stuart Scott <stu@wilf.co.uk>, and money is always accepted :P
