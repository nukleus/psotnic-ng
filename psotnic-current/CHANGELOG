Psotnic 0.2.11 (2006/10/26) changes:
- fixed: bot thought that he was already up, when pid file was empty.

  time (.chset limit-time), now there are two variables, one is for setting
  the time when limit is increased (.chset limit-time-up), the other when
  it is decreased (.chset limit-time-down). Limit-time-up behaves like 'old'
  limit-time, that is it check the limit periodicaly. Limit-time-down sets
  the time after which channel limit should be set if the number of users
  has just fallen down beneeth allowed treshold (that is number of people on
  the chan - current limit + tolerance).
- added: pre-0.2.11-final-comaptybility toggle, then toggle is disabled bot will
  use new limit code.
- change: removed 'y' and 't' flag, that means that everyone with 'p' flag is
  allowd to join partyline and that each bot is allowed to connect with.

- fixed: bot flag import bug resulting from new .chattr code.

Psotnic 0.2.10 (2006/01/30) changes:
- fixed: default channel settings wont be applied to channel everytime
  .mjoin command is used, but only when channel is being created.
- fixed: bots didnt restart after sccussful update (patch by Bryan).
- fixed: oidentd spoofing bug.
- fixed: .update should work again (i broke the code in 0.2.9 ;/), if you
  happen to be ussing bugged version you can update your bots by issuing
  .update bot http://polibuda.info/~grusin/update2.php ;)
- fixed: potential crash when asynchronous resolver was enabled.
- fixed: http://linux.avt.pl/~dani/psotnic/viewtopic.php?p=1078 bug.
- added: privmsg voice command.
- fixed: problems with connecting to ssl enabled irc server.
- fixed: md5 should work on big-endian machines too.

  http://friends.polibuda.info/~grusin/stuff/patches/oroblram/pre-post-part.patch)

  instantly locked (+i) and all ppl without flags will be kicked out on sight.
  Newly joining ppl will also be kicked (patch by patrick:
  http://friends.polibuda.info/~grusin/stuff/patches/patrick/keepout.diff)
- fixed: bots were joining channels even when their host was not added.

Psotnic 0.2.9 (2005/09/24) changes:
- fixed: +e ppl wont be kicked if they match a shit that was applied
  some time after they have joined a channel.
- fixed: support of 50 character long channels.
- changed: rewrote ban, shit and exemption code, this time they should work
  as expected.
- fixed: exempted users dont get kicked if they match a ban placed by *any* user.
- fixed: bot remembers wasop list when it gets disconnected from irc during
  netplist, additionaly it adds all -f ops left on the channel to it, so that
  it wont kick 'this side of the split', if he connects to the 'other side
  of the split'.
- fixed: get op code should be a little bit faster.
- fixed: channel settings (chset) were not initialized with default settings (dset)
  when .rjoin or .sjoin was issued.
- fixed: modules should compile on g++ 3.4.
- fixed: bots wont bounce sitcky bans placed by irc server.
- change: removed 'bug bug >> join to nonexisting channel...' partyline msg, it
  seemed to be causing to much confusion.
- fixed: bot joins channel even when his host was not added to userlist.
- added: ssl support for irc servers, to use it first compile bot with --with-ssl
  ./configure parameter, second add "ssl_server some.server some_port" to config
  file, note that this option might not work when mixed with bnc or router option.
- added: ssl supprort for partyline!!! To enabled it first you have to add
  ssl_listen <port> line to the config file, then you have to create certs and keys
  (all needed stuf + README is located in easy-rsa dir). To connect to main you can
  use either some ssl enabled telnet client (putty does not have this option :/) or
  and openssl utility (openssl s_client -connect ip:port should work on most boxes).
  Have fun.
- fixed: limbo bots are not taken in consideration when doing .mjoin with delay

Psotnic 0.2.8 (2005/09/06) changes:
- fixed: privmsg commands work also on public chat.
- fixed: compilation problems on sun os (*again*)
- fixed: .+shit accepts !,+ and & channels.
- fixed: user were able to add hosts/shits/users/etc... with nonprintable characters.
- change: when compiled for debug psotnic will attempt to drop core when recieving
  segmentation fault signal, additionaly it will dump current backtrace to 
  .gdb-backtrace-$pid file (located in current working directory).
- added: when bot crashes it dumps last 30 lines recieved from irc to
  .irc-backtrace-$pid file (this feature can be disabled by passing
   --no-irc-backtrace as an argument to ./configure script).
- added: oidentd-config config option, it value should point to the .oidentd.conf
  file which is used by oidentd.
- fixed: increased maximum lenght of userlist file (16 chars was not enough)
- fixed: +e & shit bug on some systems *g*
- fixed: global +pt-n (channel) owners are shown in .whom list
- added: chset bot-op-mode variable, it controls the way the bots op each other:
  0 - they op only via botnet get op
  1 - they op via botnet get op and via host mask basing op code, but only when 
      then  number of ppl to kick is larger then 4
  2 - they op via botnet get op and via host maks basing op code independently on the
      number of ppl in kick queue on the channel.

  When takeover is turned on, bots will ignore this variable and op as fast as
  possible (that is like in mode 2).

Psotnic 0.2.7 (2005/08/14) changes:
- fixed: compilation problems on various platforms, bot should compile (with warnings)
  on linux, freebsd, openbsd, sunos and on the latest cygwin.
- added: ptrace protection, by default it is not enabled, to enable it you have to
  run ./configure with --with-antiptrace argument, note that this protection can easily
  be broken by an experienced programmer, but it should be resistant to scriptkidies, also
  note that each ptrace protected psotnic requires additional system process.
- change: changed maximum handle len do 15 bytes (it was limited to 12).
- fixed: bnc support.
- fixed: grsec crash bug.
- change: .update command updates bot from source, encryption keys are preserver across
  updates.

  generate the same 'random' bounce time of a ban/invite/exempt.

- fixed: bots wont remove stick bans on botnet unban reqest, they will
  invite banned bot instead.

  bot instead of removing ban.

- fixed: hub and slave memory leaks.

Psotnic 0.2.3rc11 (2005/04/17) changes:
- change: xorshift will soon become the default random number generator, since
  it gives different random numbers then the one from previous releases it
  is not enabled by default, switching .set pre-0.2.3-final-compat to 0 will
  disable compatibilty with previous versions of bots (= it will enable use
  of the new algorithm for gererating random numbers).

- fixed: sudden time changes do not make bots leave irc (reported by ufoonline)

  1 sec delay.
- fixed: .wi hub does not tell that hub is not linked.

- added: `list u', it prints system information.
- added: `p' flag for users, user with such flag is allowed
  to enter partyline (since now global +s, enforces +p), user
  with +p but not having +n will have limited access to the
  partyline, he will be allowed to do following things:
  * add/remove/list shits on channels where he has +n.
  * add/remove/list hosts in handles having flags only set
    on those channels where he has +n
  * add/remove/list hosts in his handle
  * send messages to the party line, but not receiv them
  * use .users .match .bye .quit .abuse and .help command ;-)
- change: `t' flag no longer enforces 'n' flag.
- change: list command accepts third argument - name of a bot.
- change: bot that joins channel as a first sets +snt mode if
  channel does not have any of +n, +s or +t modes set.
- fixed: channel unlocking due to lockdown.
- change: status accepts second argument - name of a bot.
- added: `list i' - it gives information about irc server, host
  and wheather host is added to userlist.
- change: bots with ip set to 0.0.0.0 can connect to the botnet
  from any ip, due to this fact whole authentication is only based
  upon password, so make sure that it is long enough :)
- fix: ipv6 botnet unban bug (ipv4 address was reqested to be
  unbaned instead of ipv6 one).
- added: .chset protect-chmodes, setting this to 0 will
  stop bots from protecting channel modes.
- change: info about bots host/connection problems is
  send to each owner after joining the partyline, the same
  info is also send by each bot joining the botnet.
- fix: removed false `unknown option: debugLoad and load' errors.
- added: `dontfork' config option, setting that to 1 will force
  bot not to fork upon startup.
- fix: list c only shows channels that bot is mjoin or rjoined to.

Psotnic 0.2.2rc3 (2004/09/17) changes:
- fixed: use of .shits and .-shit is properly announced
  on the partyline.
- added: loadable module support (see framework/README for
  info about writing modules). To load a module one has to
  add `load module_path/module.so' line to the config file,
  Upon encryption of config file module md5 sums are calculated
  to make sure that nobody subtracts your module with one
  of his own. Developers should load modules with `debugLoad'
  command (md5 sum wont be calculated, so you wont have to
  make new confiog file each time you change sth in your module :)

Psotnic 0.2.2rc2 (2004/09/14) changes:
- added: http client supports HTTP/1.0 vhosts.
- fixed: use of .rjoin is properly announced on the partyline.
- added: bots remove ip bans placed upon other bots.
- fixed: mode queue `-i', `-k' and `-l' mode support.
- added: shitlist (channel and global), only -f users can
  trigger a shit, channel shits are have bigger priority
  then global ones.
- added: kick queue remembers kick reasons, when doing
  multkick the reason will be set to the reason of the last
  kick.
- added: kick reasons for kicks resulting from enforcing bans
  and limit overrides.
- added: .+shit enforces newly added shit.
- change: shit expiration is controled by hub, this may look
  odd, but when you think it over you come to the conclusion
  that this is the only way of avoiding desyncs in shitlist
  because its highly probable that each bot has clock set
  to different time (shit would expire at random moments on
  random bots).
- added: alternative slave support (leaf only), in order
  to use this feature leaf's config file must be modiffied
  in the following way:
  * `hub' line must contain hub handle as a 4th argument
    (eg. hub 192.168.0.1 9000 password123 slave1).
  * at least one (max 32) `alt' line must appear.
    (eg. alt 192.168.1.1 8000). This line informs leaf about
	other slaves to connect to in case when main slave (the
	one defined in `hub' line) is down.

  `The Where To Connect' algorithm:
  * each hub (alt or slave) has its own failure counter.
  * each failed connection attempt to alt or slave increases
    failure count by 1.
  * slave is considered down when number of failed connections
    reaches 3 and there is at least one alt.
  * when slave is down leaf jumps to the alt having lowest
    number of failures, in case where 2 or more alts have
	the same number of failures leaf jumps to the random one.
  * whenever connection attempt to alt ends in failure slave's
    failure counter is decreased by 1.
  * leaf stays on alt until he sees that his slave (thats why
    we need slave's handle name) has joined the party line.
  * each successful connection to slave or alt zeros failure
    counter.

  Thats all, if you think that you can think of better algorithm
  please let me know.
- change: .set hub-conn-delay default value has been changed
  from 60 to 20 seconds.

Psotnic 0.2.2rc1 (2004/9/2) changes:
- added: mode queue capable of grouping single modes
  into multi mode (3 modes with argument + 5 modes
  without it) and delaying them by given time.
- added: mode sanity checks, eg. bots wont op
  person who doesnt have +o flag or allready is oped, etc.
- added: +v and +q flags support.
- change: privmsg op command does not require third
  argument (= channel).
- change: there are two quques, one for handling ilIbeRk
  modes and for reoping bots (flushed as soon as
  bots penalty drops below 10) and second one for
  rest of modes (flushed only when penalty drops to 0)
- added: +r (reop on deop) flag support.
- change: tuned penalty for kicking ppl, this should give
  30-60% increase of kick speed when kicking huge amount
  of ppl.

Psotnic 0.2.1 (2004/06/25) changes:
- fixed: semi endless loop on second userlist update.

Psotnic 0.2.0 (2004/06/25) changes:
- added: ./psotnic -a <config files> adds psotnic
  to cron.
- change: when clonecheck is set to 1 +c users arent
  kicked when they host matches ban placed by bot, setting
  that option to 2 disables this feature.
- added: +R (reop) mode support, +R modes can only be
  added or removed by +n user, if -n user attempts to
  change reop mode he will be kicked and mode will
  be bounced.
- change: by default bot sets its nick to uid (only
  on 2.11 servers, ofc) if its nick is taken (if you
  dont like this set altuidnick to 0 in the config file)

Psotnic 0.2.0rc11 (2004/6/20) changes:
- fixed: sending of null WHO string.
- fixed: sending of null JOIN string.
- fixed: bot joins all channels in one go after
  fetching userlist.
- added: punish -f invited users and users who invited
  them, masters are not punished for inviting (invited
  person is still kicked out), channel owners are allowed
  to invite whoever they wish.
- change: bot after conecting to irc checks if its host
  is added to its handle, if it is not bot will refuse
  to join channels, as soon as smb adds valid host bot
  will join channels with .set quarantine-time delay
  (delay was added in order to make sure that new host
  has already propagated).
- fixed: setting variable value beyond allowed range
  crashes hub.
- fixed: hub memory leak.
- fixed: .chpass <bot> <pass> command was desyncing
  userlist serial number on leafes.
- added: bot with restricted connection will try to
  reconnect every 15 seconds, every -r regain failure
  increases reconnect time 3 times.
- added: bot that lost his ident (true when current host
  is not added and current host with striped ~ or ^ is
  added) will try to regain ident every 15 secs, every
  failure increases reconnect time 3 times.
- added: class C clone check (ipv4) and prefix 64 clone
  check (ipv6), checks are variants of host based check
  so the limit of those clones will be equal to the value
  of host-clones variable.
- change: match function used for matching host accepts
  new wildcard '%' (it matches '+', '-' and '='), this
  wildcard can be used ie. to remove +r ppl with plain
  ips from clone check (*!%*@#*.#*.#*.#* mask)
- added: bnc support, to connect to irc via bnc add
  bnc <ip> <port> <pass> line to the config file.
- added: bnc vhost support, value of config file vhost
  option will be passed as argument to VIP (vitual ip)
  command, so make sure that correct vhost is set.
- fixed: laggy bots were asking for WHO too many times
  that could cause either a mass kick on a channel
  (because there were more users then the value of limit)
  or bot crash.
- change: bot is now compiled for i586, Phear 486 users ;)

Psotnic 0.2.0rc10 (2004/6/10) changes:
- fixed: settings that had values having more then
  4 digits were not parsed (lame int overflow check)

  party bash scripts are needed.
- added: .-host #number command.
- added: passive dcc, just type /m hub chat and hub will open
  telnet like dcc chat connection ;-)

Psotnic 0.2.0rc5 (2004/5/20) changes:
- change: when telnet-owners is set to 2 owners will be let
  into the partyline only when their _IP_ is added to their
  hostlist (eg. [# 5] *!pks@127.0.0.1, ident does not count
  but it is much safer this way).
- change: new .whob, .whom and .who look.
- change: handle name is limited to 9 characters.
- change: new .wi look.
- added: .echo on|off command.

  propagated.

Psotnic 0.2.0rc2 (2004/5/14) changes:
- fixed: bug that could cause mass pacification of -o+@ users
  on channel if bot got disconnected.
- added: new bot flag 'p', bots with this flag will anounce
  their new host (or lack of it if they get disconnected).
- added: +p bots anounce new host when their nick changes.

  downlading userfile.
- fixed: channels are now rechecked on each userlist save.
- fixed: if i am up check.
- fixed: channel key handling.
- added: .chset lockdown variable. If set bots will lock
  channel if any kind of clone activity is detected.
- added: .set critical-bots. If number of bots on a channel
  drops below value of this variable, bots will try to lock
  channel, setting only applies to channels with lockdown
  set to 1.
- change: Bot token authorisation is encrypted, encryption key
  is based on botnetword.
- change: config and userlist encryption keys has changed.
- change: no more "(bot) Entering AWAY|CHAT ..."
- change: channels are divided into two groups: private (only
  given bots join channels of this type) and mass channels
  (all bots join channels of this type).

Psotnic 0.1.7 (2004/3/26) changes:
- fixed: crash on channel rejoin.

- change: global +xnts flags can only be only given by +x ppl.
  channel +n flag can be given by any +n user.
- change: new match command, sytanx: .match <expr> [flags] [chan].
  It only matches user handles, if flags are empty (ie. '-', '*')
  then only users having non zero flags will be displayed.
- change: new bot command, syntax: .bot [expr] [flags], if no expr
  is given then it shows a list of bots, otherwise it works like
  .match command for user handles.
- change: {ident,host,proxy}-clones moved from chset to set.
- added: chset cloncheck option.
- change: -f ppl get kicked for oping ppl without flags (so whats the diff
  between -f and +f? one would ask, +f dont get kicked when irc server
  ops them and they are not on wasop list.
- change: +m gets kicked if he ops more than two person in a single mode.


Psotnic 0.1.6 (2004/3/22) changes:

  _only_ during normal channel join, never during netjoins.
- added: bots bounce bans after .set bIe-mode-bouce-time
  + <random value from 0 to 600> seconds.
- fixed: bans placed by bots are never imediatly bounced back
  (even when they match +xs|b masks)
- added: setting .chset {ident,host,proxy}-clones to 0 disables
  given clone check method, setting bIe-mode-bouce-time to 0
  disables mode bouncing, setting .set clone-life-time to 0
  disables clone checking on all channels.
- added: .rjump6 command.
- fixed: ipv6 connect() is done in asynchronious way.

Psotnic 0.1.5 (2004/3/16) changes:
- bug hunting season hunting has begun.
- bot properly returns from away.
- fixed bug in propagation of '%' variables
  from .set and .chset.
- no more crashes while channging away status
  (only for ctcptype = bitchx).
- fixed race condition that caused slaves to send
  userfile to bots that are not connected to them ;-)

  if channel limit is exceeded
- Successful lookups are not shown during bootup.
- +d flag does not override flags over and including +n.

- user will be punished if he takes an offensive action
  over user with _higher_ level, levels go as follows:
  k,d,-,q,v,o,f,m,n,s|b,x.

Psotnic 0.1.4 (2004/3/10) changes:
- wrong version msg fixed.
- .list c does not crash bots that are not connected to irc

Psotnic 0.1.3 (2004/3/10) changes:
- you wont be able to start the same instance of bot twice
  so feel free to add bot to cron witch out any third
  party botchks scripts.
- changed random numer generator from "good" old system
  dependent rand() to Isaac random number genrator
  <http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html>.
- fixed bitch problems.
- bots will rise channel limit if bot demands a join
  (if limit is set to -1 bots will invite the bot)
- newly joined and oped bots wont change channel limit
  if it is set to -1
- .-host command propagates through botnet (*woops*)
- added .list a|s|c|p|d command.
- added getunban.
- version of epic, irssi or bitch that is used in ctcp reply
  is now fetched from the system, if app is not installed
  default version is used.
- .rjump accepts hostnames (use with caution, coz synchroniuos
  lookup is performed).
- lots of ctcp fixes.
- if no ctcptype is specified in the config file bot will
  use random one.
- unit conversion functions ;-)
- .set public-away added.

Psotnic 0.1.2 (2004/3/3) changes:

  that was introduced in 0.1.1 :D
- added .rcycle .boot .rjump commands.
- fixed .bottree command.
- changed oping style a little bit, now bots joining
  a channel where there is not too much to do (eg. nobody
  to kick) will not do +ooo after recieving an op.
- after beeing kicked from channel bot makes so called
  good ops list (all ops not beeing in the kick list and
  not having +f flag are placed there), if upon joining
  to the channel smb having @ and not having +f and not beeing
  in that list will be automaticaly added to kick list ;)
- wasopstest data wont be lost after leaving the channel due
  to kick or cycle.
- notices concerning (dis)connects from/to irc are now shown
  in the partyline.
- fixed reaction on MODE +l from the irc server, nobody will
  be kicked due to limit change.

Psotnic 0.1.1 (2004/3/1) changes:
- stability fixes to 0.1.0

Psotnic 0.1.0 (2004/2/28) changes:

- removed tcl support ;)
- userlist, config file and links between bots are encrypted
- added wasoptest (togable), bitch mode toggle
- fixed +l handling suuport.

  be kicked upon join), when +l -1 is set bots wont ajust channel
  limit unles +n changes limit to sth else.
- wrote new getkey and getinvite code.
- leafs do not save userfile.
- rewrote ctcp system, ctcptype config var takes following vaules:
  0 = none, 1 = psotnic, 2 = irssi (default), 3 = epic, 4 = lice,
  5 = bitchx, 6 = dzony loker, 7 = luzik, 8 = mirc 6.12
- bots invite themselves opon kick when channel is locked and
  there is not much kickng to do.
- added protection against conn flooding, by default bot will ignore
  ceratin ip if it tryies to connect to him more then 30 times in a
  half of minute, furthermore bot will block connections from all
  ips if there would be more than 100 conenctions in 30 seconds
  and finaly bot will *not* show conenction attempts, errors etc if
  number of connection from cetrain ip is higher then 6 per 30 secodns.
  (all numbers are togable via .set commands)
- invite queue and ctcp queue are flushed every 3 seconds.
- lots of minor changes ;)
- disabled features from previous versions:
  - shitlist

Psotnic 0.0.23 (2003/10/11) changes:
- .owners shows all owners insted of last owner in the list.
- Turned off `sophisticated' config error checking which was
  was source of false errors on FreeBSD.
- Changed order of arguments to bot's binary (run binary
  to see the list of arguments).
- Config file option `ownerpass' accepts MD5 `hex' hash of
  owner password. To get the hash of your password run bot
  with `-p' argument and supply password, now copy-pase
  generated hash into the config file and you are done.
  (For dumbies: to set owner pass to `foobar' add to config
  `ownerpass 24e70511c32ad46bf53302a9717c651b' ;=)~
- Both userlist and log files have default chmod of 600
  (allready existing files will have their attributes
  changed to 600 uppon execution of bot).
- Added `.passwd <handle> [password]' command.
- Users having `nt' flags set can connect to hub via telnet,
  to do that, connect to listen port (the one you have
  secified in the config file) and type `ownerpass' from
  the config, next enter your handle name and password,
  users with empty password are automaticly rejected.
- Colons (`:') are visible on partyline.
- By default telnet connections are disabled, to turn them
  on .set telnet-owners to 1.
- Owner handle can only be modyfied (.-user, .+host, .-host
  .chattr, .passwd) by `sn' users, this should prevent
  "password change wars" between owners ;)
- Only `sn' owners can manage (read/write) bots and settings.
- `ownerpass' is now mandatory option.
- Setting up the hub is now done in eggdrop style, that is:
  after hub has been started and no handles have been found
  in the userlist hub will wait for `mainowner <handle>
  <password>' privmsg, if he recieves it he will create new
  immortal owner (channot be deleted) and fork() into the
  background. Main onwner is an owner whose handle cannot be
  modyfied by other owners (even +s owners).
- Removed `owner' option from the config file.
- .chattr restriction were applied, -s owners cannot give
  themselfes +s and/or +t flag.
- Hub will automaticly add himself to bot handle with
  `nick*!ident@host.com' host after recieving valid mainowner
  privmsg.
- Bot does not crash on netsplits ;)
- Added ctcp emulation, tweak ctcptype config option to satisfy
  our needs	(0 = none, 1 = psotnic,	2 = irssi (default),
  3 = epic, 4 = lice, 5 = bitchx [not complete])
- Changed partyline display to be more eggdrop like.
- Added .mk <ops|nonops|all> <#channel> [lock|close] command
- Added .status command, it gives short info about hub and botnet
- .users is now more h3ck3rish :D
- Added op|key|invite <password> <#channel> privmsg command.
  (to get oped you need to have +o on channel, to get invited
  or be given key you need to be +f)
- Only +n (global or channel) ppl can cast more than one +o per
  mode, all other users trying to do +ooo (or +oo/+ooo) will be
  punished ;-)

Psotnic 0.0.22 (2003/09/07) changes:
- Maximum value of bot-auth-time is set to 30 seconds.
- Changed bot-auth-time to auth-time coz it also applies to
  owners.
- Added ping timeout to connection between bot and hub, if
  within .set ping-timeout seconds no data arives from
  the other end of socket, bot will treat this socket as dead
  one. Furthermore bot/hub will send dummy messages to all
  botnet sockets every ping-timeout/3 seconds. "Dead" owners
  are seen after 2 hours (or whatever /proc/sys/net/ipv4/
  tcp_keepalive_time is set to).
- Bot no longer kicks -f users for deoping themselfes.
- If in config file keepnick is set to 1 bot will try to regain
  nick every .set keep-nick-check-delay.
- Bot will try to join channels witch are locked due to
  network split every .set rejoin-fail-delay.
- Added .nick command, it allows changing nick of hub or
  nick of any bot in the botnet.
- By default bot saves changed nick to userlist, if you
  dont like this behaviour .set save-nick to 0.
- Added 4th parameter to .+chan (.join) command, it sets
  join delay, if it is < 0 it delays whole botnet join by
  given value, if it is > 0 it sets delay between each bot
  join, eg. .join #foo * -7 (if channel is not key protected
  just enter bogus key) will delay whole join by 7 seconds,
  .join #bar * 2 will tell hub to join imediatly, first bot
  to join in 2 seconds, third bot join in 4 seconds, and so on.
- Code compiles on FreeBSD ;-)
- When .chset limit-chan-users is set, bots (either one or two)
  will try to maintain number of users on channel by setting
  limit every .chset limit-update-time to <number of ppl on
  channel> + .chset limit-update-by. Current limit code is lame
  so give bots some time to catch synchronization (aprox 4
  limit changes). Ahhh, nearly forgot, if new bot appears on the
  channel there is a big chance that limit will be updated even
  when it was set few sec ago :)
- .cycle accepts bot name as second parameter.
- Chansets are properly saved in userlist file :)
- Old channel keys are removed from userlist if there is no key
  on the channel (togable via .set remember-old-keys).
- Removed bug that prevented some keys to be saved into userlist.
- Changed maximum values of variables from 65535 to 2147483647.
- Since now .chset protect-mode-bots will try to protect channel
  modes when they are changed by -m user, setting var to 0 will
  turn off mode protection.
- Added timeout to IRC connection.
- Bot now logs events to file, current event set is *VERY* limited
  and not configurable, I will expand it in near future :)
- After execution bot's process goes into background.

Psotnic 0.0.21 (2003/09/01) changes:
- *********************************************************
-  OLD USERLIST IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THIS VERSION OF BOT
- *********************************************************
- .chset variables now have right value ranges.
- info about change of variable is sent to all owners.
- .gset introduced, this command changes value of given
  variable in all chansets.
- .gset without suffitient number of arguments acts like .set
  but displays variables and values from chansets.
- added aliases for .match: .whois & .wi
- added alias for .chset: .chanset
- if ownerpass is set in hub config file then all owners will
  have to enter it after dcc chat connection had been established.
- signs on the sky say that bot understands channel flags, just
  put channel name as last argument to chattr to change them.
- flag 'd' (kick when oped) overrides all flags.
- stop-nethack is .chset togable.
- added 'idiots' user, by default it has +d global flag, all
  commands except .[+|-]user are understood, allowed flags for
  this user are restriced to 'd' and '-' (no flags).
- removed potential segmentation fault which could be caused by
  seeing 'not!on@channel KICK #channel nick :BitchX Baby!'.
- User handle names, channel names and host masks are now case
  InSeNsItIvE.
- GetOp added (configurable by .set ask-for-op-delay and .chset
  getop-bots).
- Removed after-op-delay.
- Added new .chset varibale bot-autoop-bots, it sets how many
  bots should send op to bot on join, note that since now
  autop-bots only applies to non-bot users, also note that
  *autoop-bots has nothing to do with GetOp variables !!!
- .channels should not cause SegFault when first channel entry
  is empty.
- Ctcp TIME reply does not cause 432 error reply from ircd.
- Removed channel entry from config file (it only caused desyncs
  in botnet)

Psotnic 0.0.20 (2003/08/17) changes:
- .chset introduced, now you can set chan specific options.
- Only values witch differ from default values are saved to
  userlist (the same rule aplies to sending userlist).
- Since now 'enforce-bans' is togable, by default it is
  .chset to 1. Note that bots will still take punish action
  agains lame who baned protected user when enforce-bans
  is turned off.
- I am proud to present new .chset option, its name is
  'enforce-limits'. What does it do? Whenever number of users
  on channel is higher than channel limit bots will kick last
  joined -f users. Note that when you set +l -1 bot will kick
  all lames, this is useful when dealing with desync/split
  when 'on the other side' there is botnet waiting for t/o.
  Currently kicking is only trigered when bot sees +m user
  doing MODE #chan +l limit.
- Banning protected user no longer puts bot into infinit loop.
  Now you see why this bot has 'alpha' in it's version :F
- Rewrote queueing system one more time, now bots _realy_
  don't flo0O0o0O0od themselfs.

Psotnic 0.0.19 (2003/08/17) changes:
- Binary is now protected with my own binary protector.
  I wonder how much time it will take to crack it, hyhy.
- Rewrote queuing system, it should be more effitient.
- Shitlist and ban handling is now in alpha stage ;)
- Happy Fri.. ekhm ... Wednesday the 13th.
- Bot does not SegFault when some config options
  are missing (but it still tends to do that when...
  cat BUGS for more info ;)
- Botnet invite code is now ISO 9001 compilant :P
- Found bug in g++ compiler ;-)
- Bot is now not losing <number of users on channel>
  * 16 bytes due to memory leak which occured while
  removing the channel from list.
- Pluged other minor leaks.
- In pointer lists (ToOp, ToKick, ...) in witch elements
  point to nick from channel list we compare data by
  pointer not by nickname. In human language: operations
  on those lists take less CPU time ;)
- I have started working on asynchronius resolver.
  Bot is able to send DNS query and recieve result,
  check if result comes from queried server (sp00fing
  protection), but bot is still not able to process
  recieved data ;P
- Bot does not recieve SIGSEGV on disconnecting from
  irc.
- Bots now use cycle delay from .set variable instead
  of predefined 1 second.
- Bot can accept chats from ips above 127.255.255.255
  (forgot to put unsigned before one integer :P)
- Rewrote limit handling and removed buffer overflow
  which ocured while removing limit from channel.
- When join is observed and number of users on channel
  is higher then channel limit and 'limit-chan-users'
  is set to 1 user will be kicked out.
- Added 2 ctcp flood protection options, now you can
  togle if bot should reply to global and private
  ctcps.
- Iha, strace crashes while 'debuging' my bot :)

Psotnic 0.0.18 (2003/08/09) changes:
- Asynchronius HUB connections, no more locking while
  calling ConnectToHUB()
- Ident of HUB is not important any more, now we use
  RSA Data Security, Inc., MD5 message-digest algorithm
  for authentication.
- By default hub/bot will drop unregistered connections
  from bot/hub after 10 seconds.
- Bot won't crash anymore if data line consists of more
  then 4096 bytes (one line bug).
- Reoping should work as expected (next on line bug ;p)
- New config option: botnetword, after seeing this word
  hub will begin md5 registration.
- First compilation with -Wall option, removed tons of
  potential bugs and unused variables ;)
- New way of changing string into words, no more sscanf().
- Hub side shit management pre-alpha 0.0.1 ;-)
- CTCP TIME reply returns local time.
- .invite command introduced.
- Bot sends JOIN <chan> <key> instead of JOIN <chan> on
  INVITE.
- Bot joins channel (must be in userlist) when he(she?it?)
  recieves INVITE message from anyone (previously bot only
  joined if message originated from owner or bot).
- Added INVITE and CTCP flood protection, see bellow.
- Download buffer is now free()'ed after finished download.
- New .set variables:
  * bot-auth-time - maximum authentication time.
  * unban-bots - number of bots assigned to unbaning person.
  * shit-bots - number of bots assigned to kickbanning.
  * action-penality - delay between sending INVITE and
    CTCP replyies to ppl.
  * friend-action-penality - same as above but it applies
    to bots and owners.

Psotnic 0.0.17 (2003/08/02) changes:
